    "> Before continuing, please note that we are using Jupyter Notebooks. These are essentially powerful Google Docs with code that can actually be ran. Read the markdown (the paragraphs that are formatted) and when you get to a code section, you can click the play button. If it asks what kernal to use, select `Jupyter Kernal` and then `Java` Kernal or just `Java` kernal if that pops up. You can then edit the code and see how it reacts with different inputs and code. \n",
